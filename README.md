# Eileen Wang's final project

# An Outline - High level summary of my project
How happy people are is a difficult question to answer- afterall, happiness is not a concept you can generalize to the mass easily. I'm interested in understanding how different countries score in factors that affect how people people are - such as social support, freedom to make life choices, and generosity. 

# An Outline- Project structure / Story arc
Beginning - An introduction to factors that determine happiness: I want to show a map view of the happiness score of people across different countries, without any additional clues for why. At this point, viewers may take a moment to process and note the factors that play into the happiness ranking.  

Climax - Realization that happiness is not a checklist: The initial assumption may be that each factor has equal weight in determining happiness. However, I want to share charts that show the relationship of two or more factors in affecting each country. For example, social support is highly correlated to healthy life expectancy. This might help viewers realize that the best way to obtain happiness is not checking off each factor from their list. Rather, it's about examinining the relationship of two factors at play in their life. 

Call to action - Finding happiness is actually a tangible process: In the end, I want viewers to feel that obtaining happiness can be a tactile plan. To have a healthy life expectancy, find social support. I might link the audience to links like meetup.com to help them start building more extensive social circles.

# The data
This dataset is from the ![World Happiness Report 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2019.csv), which is supported by the United Nations, and also studied by global leaders to understand how they can improve happiness for citizens. The 6 factors that were used to estimate a overarching happiness score for each nation are: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. 

I plan to plot the data onto a map to begin with, which will ignite viewer curiousity to study the rankings of each country. However, I am also looking to dig deeper into the relationship of pairs of factors, to understand if there is any correlation. I might use bar charts to illustrate where there is strong relationships and weak relationships. 

# Method and medium
I plan on building my story using Shorthand. I think the linear format (scrolling down) will work well for helping viewers focus on one piece of information at a time, and not jump to conclusion. 

From here, I plan on
